# Machine-Learning-and-Arduino
this is a project that calculate the ration of precipitation based on temperature of the day and humidity using the model of linear regression 
first thing we gonna collecte the data for the every month and year , humidity temperature and what was the percipitation according to every condition
and after that preparing tha data(cleanning delete ...) and after that chose a model for that for this project we use the linear regression because we have continuous variable and the output gonna be continuous(equation =wTemp+xHumidity+b)
and we use the language R to find the weights (w,x).
and now we have to build a prototype with arduino board and sensor for tempereture and humidity the values that the sensors gonna capturer is gonna be the the input to calcule the ratio of percipitation
